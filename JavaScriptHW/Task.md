# Overview

The goal of the final project is to create your own accessible, interactive photo gallery. Building on concepts you have been learning in the course you will create your own HTML file with images and alternative text and then add the code to call functions to react  to common events such page loads, mouse movement, and keyboard access.  In addition to reusing the functions from the earlier homework you will want to write code to automatically add the tabindex attribute to your figures.

Throughout the process make sure to validate your code on W3, Wave, and aXe.

Once you have completed your assignment you will complete peer reviews.  Because there are two or three challenging components to this assignment I hope  you will learn from seeing the different approaches.

# Instructions

- ✅ Use the code from the Interactive Photo Gallery as your starting point

- ✅ Update the code to use six images of your choice, making sure to include alternative text for each.

- Validate your site on The W3C Markup Validation Service.

- Validate your site using the Wave validator site or browser extension.

- Validate your site using the aXe browser extension.

- Add the listeners for onfocus Event  and onblur Event using the same pattern I gave you for the onmouseover Event and onmouseleave Event.  (Don't delete those events though!)

- Test your site's functionality for mouse movement.

- Add the listener for onload – deciding what you want to call the new function

- Add the new function for adding the tabfocus attribute

- Add a console.log message to make sure that your event triggers
- Write a for loop to loop through each image
- Add the tabindex attributes
- Test your site's functionality for keyboard access.
- Host and share your site
- Complete your peer reviews.
