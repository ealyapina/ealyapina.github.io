          Jure has a good relationship with his undergraduate student.
           The student always comes in time, listens carefully to the instructions,
            takes notes and asks questions when unclear. Jure created a timeline to
             help his undergraduate student to prepare the research
              paper stress-free and ahead of time. The student
               missed all the deadlines Jure suggested and turned

        <h2 class="fact">No distortion</h2>
          <p class="fact">Jury could have suspected the student
             of being disrespectful, blame himself of being a
              bad advisor, but would it help get the research paper faster? I doubt it.</p>
